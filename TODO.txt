* Merge sizes syntax check from get_image_rules() / get_art_image_rules() and process_dimensions()
* Prevent breaking errors during the process and add error instead
* Check at end of function calls if there were any errors and return/show them
* Limit api usage with sizes presets to prevent abuse
* Enable more crop functionality by switching to $wp_editor->crop instead of $wp_editor->resize
