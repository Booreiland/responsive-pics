* Move all image checks in get_definition() to ResponsivePics()->process->process_image()
* Rename ResponsivePics()->definitions->get_definition -> ResponsivePics()->process->process_sizes()
* In get_image_rules() / get_art_image_rules() rename $reverse = false -> $order = 'ASC'
* Merge sizes syntax check from get_image_rules() / get_art_image_rules() and process_dimensions()
* Prevent breaking errors during the process and add error instead
* Check at end of function calls if there were any errors and return/show them
* Limit api usage with sizes presets to prevent abuse
